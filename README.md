# Purpose

This repository is part of my ARL/SAA Mosaic Fellow internship at the Special Collection Research Center (University of Michigan Libraries). I am developing a program that allows a metadata crosswalk for the Joseph Labadie Subject Vertical File. I am crosswalking from a local arrangement to a EAD/MODS metadata schema so it can be bulk uploaded into ArchivesSpace. Also I will be proposing a arrangement plan to move groupings of subject headings from a vertical file level to a collection level.
