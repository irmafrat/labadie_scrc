# labadie_scrc
This repository is part of my ARL/SAA Mosaic Fellow internship at the Special Collection Research Center (University of Michigan Libraries). I am developing a program that allows a metadata crosswalk for the Joseph Labadie Subject Vertical File. I am crosswalking from a local arrangement to a EAD/MODS metadata schema so it can be bulk uploaded into ArchivesSpace.
